            Like the boid algorithm that simulates flocking behavior through simple rules,
            my diverse interests follow patterns that create something greater than the sum
            of their parts.

          This site features a custom navigation system inspired by the classic arcade game Q*bert!
          Click on the isometric cubes to jump between different sections of the site.

          Watch as Q*bert hops from cube to cube, changing their colors and revealing
          new content with each jump.

              I'm a generalist to the extremeâ€”a polymath with a background in science,
              engineering, and electronics. Currently pursuing nursing education, I
              explore the connections between seemingly disparate fields.
            </p>
            <p>
              My online persona revolves around the concept of boids (bird-oid objects),
              an algorithm that simulates the flocking behavior of birds. Just as simple
              rules guide each boid to create complex flocking behavior, I follow my
              curiosity across disciplines to discover emergent patterns and connections.
