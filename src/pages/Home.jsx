              I'm a generalist to the extremeâ€”a polymath with a background in science,
              engineering, and electronics. Currently pursuing nursing education, I
              explore the connections between seemingly disparate fields.
            </p>
            <p>
              My online persona revolves around the concept of boids (bird-oid objects),
              an algorithm that simulates the flocking behavior of birds. Just as simple
              rules guide each boid to create complex flocking behavior, I follow my
              curiosity across disciplines to discover emergent patterns and connections.

          This site features a custom navigation system inspired by the classic arcade game Q*bert!
          Click on the isometric cubes to jump between different sections of the site.

          Watch as Q*bert hops from cube to cube, changing their colors and revealing
          new content with each jump.

            My digital playground exploring the intersections of nursing, electronics,
            engineering, and science through the lens of emergent behavior.

          <p>
            Like the boid algorithm that simulates flocking behavior through simple rules,
            my diverse interests follow patterns that create something greater than the sum
            of their parts.
