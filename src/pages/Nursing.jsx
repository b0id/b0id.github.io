            <h2>My Nursing Journey</h2>
            <p>
              As a student nurse with a background in engineering and electronics,
              I bring a unique perspective to healthcare. The systematic thinking
              required in engineering translates well to nursing assessment and care
              planning, while my electronics knowledge helps me understand and work
              with medical technologies.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              My fascination with emergent behaviors in boid algorithms has led me
              to recognize similar patterns in patient care and healthcare systems.
              Just as simple rules guide each boid to create complex flocking behavior,
              nursing protocols and best practices guide individual care actions that
              together create comprehensive patient care.

            <h2>Learning Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
              My approach to nursing education is influenced by my background in
              systems thinking and emergent behavior. I believe that understanding
              the underlying patterns and connections between different aspects of
              healthcare leads to more holistic and effective patient care.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just as a boid simulation creates complex flocking behavior from
              simple rules, nursing practice integrates countless small decisions
              and actions into comprehensive care. This perspective helps me connect
              the dots between different aspects of nursing knowledge.
